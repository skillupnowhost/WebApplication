# Verifying MyLoginn (Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4 + framer-motion)

## Launch
- Dev server: `npm run dev` (port 3000). Check first — it is often already running: `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 -State Listen`. Dev server hot-reloads, no restart needed after edits.

## Drive (GUI surface)
- Playwright is a devDependency but scripts outside the repo must require it by absolute path: `require("e:/MyLoginn/node_modules/playwright")`.
- Mobile testing: `viewport: { width: 390, height: 844 }, isMobile: true, hasTouch: true`.
- The mobile hamburger is `button[aria-label="Toggle menu"]` with `aria-expanded` reflecting state.
- Gotcha: desktop nav links exist in the DOM but are hidden on mobile — `text=Internships` matches the hidden desktop link first. Scope selectors with `:visible`, e.g. `page.locator('a[href="/internships"]:visible')`.
- Wait ~900ms after opening the menu for the spring + stagger animations to settle before screenshotting.

## Theme
- The app **forces light theme**: `ThemeProvider.tsx` sets `forcedTheme="light"`. Dark-mode CSS exists but is unreachable at runtime — don't try to verify dark mode via `colorScheme` emulation or localStorage; it won't apply.

## Other gotchas
- lucide-react is v1.x: old alias names were removed (`Home` → `House`, `Code2` → `CodeXml`). Check `node_modules/lucide-react/dist/lucide-react.d.ts` when adding icons.
- This Next.js version differs from public docs — see `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (e.g. `next/image` uses `preload`, not `priority`).

## Admin panel (/admin)
- Log in as `admin@myloginn.ai` / `Admin@123` (from prisma/seed.ts) — login redirects ADMIN users to /admin.
- The admin shell suppresses the site navbar/footer; its mobile hamburger is `button[aria-label="Open menu"]`, the drawer is `aside.z-50`.
- `PageTransition` is skipped on /admin: its animated `filter`/`transform` would otherwise become the containing block for the admin shell's fixed overlays (drawer, modals, toasts) and pin them to the page instead of the viewport. Don't re-wrap admin routes in animated containers.
- Every admin add/edit/delete goes through a ConfirmDialog — automation must click "Yes, …" in the popup after submitting a form (or press Enter: Enter confirms, Escape cancels the popup).
- Esc on an entity form with unsaved edits opens a "Discard changes?" ConfirmDialog instead of closing; a pristine form closes immediately.
- Dialog exit springs take ~1s to unmount — wait ≥1000ms before asserting a `[role="dialog"]`/`[role="alertdialog"]` is gone, or you get false negatives.
